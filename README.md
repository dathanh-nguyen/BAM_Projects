This repository contains various Data Science projects I did as part of my Master's degree. 

The `Advanced Statistics` folder contains three individual assignments I undertook as part of the course, with each focusing on a different aspect of advanced statistics/econometrics:
- Assignment 1 focused on basic OLS Regression and Subset Analysis
- Assignment 2 focused on Difference-in-Difference and Instrumental Variable Analysis
- Assignment 3 focused on the modelling of Panel Data, Counts Data and Ordinal Data with different types of regressions

The code used for each of the assignments is included at the end of the respective PDF files. 

The `Database Management and SQL` folder contains the Integrated Assignment I made for the course Database Management and Ethics. This assignment revolved around working with district data from the Chicago Police Department to answer a set of 4 self-defined questions using SQL data analysis. See the PDF file for more details. The folder also contains SQBPRO file containing my SQL code and a backup text file containing the code used. 

The `Machine Learning` folder contains the notebook files for two Machine Learning projects (both group projects) I undertook as part of my general Machine Learning (Predicting Booking Cancellations) and Python (Predicting Start-Up Funding) courses. I was responsible for developing the Random Forest model in the Booking Cancellations Project, and the Gradient Boosting Model in the Start-Up Funding Project (these were also the best performing models in each group assignment). The code for those sections was almost exclusively developed by me. 

The `Optimization Projects - Gurobi` folder contains Jupyter notebook files as well as PDF files for the various optimization projects I did during my Master's. 
- Assignment 1 focused on Decision Trees and general Linear Programming
- The Group Assignment focused on Integer Programming 
- Assignment 2 focused on Binary and Stochastic Programming 

For the Group Assignment, I was responsible for developing the actual mathematical model and its implementation in Gurobi.
